My team, the Voyagers, designed and built a safety rocking chair adapter as our GEEN 2400 project. Here's how we did it.

## Project Overview

The final product is a box in which any chair can be placed, allowing the chair to rock safely. It adds under 2" to the overall height of the chair, can be easily removed and reattached, has bump stops to prevent tipping, and is enclosed to reduce pinching hazards. The chair is attached to the rocker with a vise-style clamp, which can be adjusted to fit essentialy any chair. It's surprisingly comfortable to sit in and convenient to use, while also being safe and affordable.

## Background and Client

As part of our research and ideation process, we reached out to several local primary schools to learn more about what challenges teachers face in the classroom, and found that a common theme was students need to move around to stay focused. An obvious solution to that problem  is to provide students rocking chairs, but that's an imperfect answer. We learned that they're quite expensive, and students have a tendency to fall out of them and try to crush things (or themselves) under the rockers.

We chose to work closer with an occupational therapist from the Boulder Valley School District, who was able to give us further insight into how the school system works and what the needs of students are. While for the purposes of this project she and people like her were considered our client, our target audience was the students themselves.

When researching competetion, we discovered another product that was akin to trampolines on each leg, and asked our client if she had any experience with them. She explained that often students who had attachments like that would bounce and get amped up, which was the opposite of the intended soothing effect we were looking for.

We also found throughout the semester that while we were sitting at our table in rolling chairs, we would often fidget and rock back and forth. This made us realize that we too could benefit from this idea, and that there was a larger market for our product beyond just elementary students.

## Design Requirements

Early in the project, we decided on some critical design requirements based on feedback and meetings with clients and our own research and experience.

- **Safety**
  - The chair should resist over-rocking, to make accidental tipping less likely.
  - The rockers should be enclosed to prevent pinching hazards.
  - The chair should be firmly attached to the rockers, and should not come loose during regular use and light handling.
- **Comfort**
  - The rocker should add little height to the overall chair, to maintain a comfortable sitting height and to fit under desks.
  - The rocker design should feel nice to rock in, rocking enough to be enjoyable but not enough to be scary or hazardous.
- **Adaptablity**
  - The rocker should be adjustable to fit a wide range of chair sizes and shapes.
  - The rocker should be easily removable and reattachable, to allow for easy storage and transport.
  - The rocker assembly size should be minimized to allow for transport.
- **Customizability**
  - The chair should fit in to any classroom setting and prevent the students from excessively standing out to others.

## Design Process

The deisgn process was full of endless roadblocks. Early on, we were asking ourselves why nobody had created a product like this, because it seemed like such an elegant solution to an obvious problem. We quickly learned that the problem was not as simple as we had thought, and that there were many factors to consider.

Throughout this project, I primarially worked on manufacturing and prototyping, and all of the processes that go along with that. I led the production side of things, including machining and part selection. I also handled material testing, and was responsible for the design and assembly of the clamping mechanism. Jacob and I worked together on the rocker arc design, and Jacob did the CAD.

### Rocker Arc Prototyping

Rocker arcs are significatnly more complex than we expected, and finding the right shape took quite a lot of trial and error. There's plenty of resources online to help, and [Rocking Chair University](https://www.rockingchairuniversity.com) (turns out that's a real thing) was a phenomenal resource to help us get background on how they're typically designed. The big issue, though, was when designing a typical rocking chair the actual chair geometry is known. In our case though, when designing a rocker intended to work for anything, we have to design for everything.

![Initial Arc](/assets/geen-2400/scary_arc.jpg){:style="float: right; margin:10px" width="40%"}

To get an idea of what we were facing, we dove into prototyping physical rockers. While usually it may make more sense to start with CAD, we found that the physical prototypes were much more helpful in understanding how the chair would feel, as obviously CAD can't convey that. The first design was absolutely terrifying. Based on our research we thought that a 14 degree arc would be ideal. Unfortunately, it added about four inches of height, and when we first put a chair on it fell over backwards. We considered this to be a significant design issue, as we found throughout our research that chairs work much better when they're upright.

From there, we did several more arc iterations, often making an arc and then modifying it slightly to a new curve. This was very time-intensive, as we were working with large pieces of high dentisty wood and didn't have any digital fabrication equipment to make them quickly and precisely. We had to hand cut each one on a band saw and then sand it with a belt sander. This meant that iterations took a long time, so we would often simply modify our current iteration until it felt good and then measure it to reproduce it.

![Final Arc](/assets/geen-2400/arc_prototype.jpg){:style="float: left; margin:10px" width="40%"}

Finally, we settled on a 7 degree arc. This felt like a low number, but it felt the most comfortable. We also lowered the chair, deciding to have it sit just over an inch and a half higher. This was the lowest rocker height that still felt nice to rock on, and we felt that it was a good compromise between comfort and practicality. We also made the rocker longer, realizing that the chair should sit towards the front of the rocker to place the center of mass closer to the center of the rocker. This made the chair feel more stable and less likely to tip.

### Clamp Design

Attaching the chair to the rockers was also much more difficult than we expected. During the prototyping process, we simply cut holes and grooves in the arc to fit the two specific chair models we were working with. Obviously, this wouldn't work long-term, so we had to come up with a better solution. Our first idea was to use small clamps purchased off Amazon to puch against the chair legs and hold them that way. We quickly learned that this wouldn't work, because the clamps were weak and did little more to hold the chair than just sitting on top of the rocker. Also, the mechanical design to make them adapt to any chair design was very complicated, and they didn't work for chairs with bars on the bottom. So, we went back to the drawing board.

![Clamp Concept](/assets/geen-2400/clamp_concept.jpg){:style="float: right; margin:10px" width="40%"}

Eventually, we took inspiration from a vise. They have an incredibly strong clamping force while still being easy to use. We grabbed some wood and threw together a basic concept to help us better understand our idea. We decided to make the mechanism out of aluminum because it is easily machinable and quite strong, while also remaining relativly affordable. We also decided to simply use an off-the-shelf bolt to tighten the vise, saving significant money and development time. We made sure it made physical sense in CAD[^1], and then got to machining aluminum.

![Texturing Process](/assets/geen-2400/texturing_process.jpg){:style="float: left; margin:10px" width="40%"}

The macining process went relatively well. The design involved two thinner pieces of aluminum embedded in the wooden rocker to hold everything together, one of which was threaded for the bolt. The bolt would simply press against the inner, thicker piece of aluminum, which would slide along dowels to clamp on the chair. The inner piece of aluminum was spring loaded so that when the bolt was loosened, it would automatically move away from the chair, making it easy to remove. The aluminum surfaces that would contact the chair were textured using a custom fly cutter we designed to roughen them and help them grip the chair. All in all, the design was simple and elegant.

![Two Bolts CAD](/assets/geen-2400/two_bolts_cad.png){:style="float: right; margin:10px" width="40%"}

Initially, we used a single bolt in the center of the rocker to hold the chair, but the aluminum deflected more than we expected and did not hold the chair well enough. So, we slightly modified the design to include two bolts spaced further apart, which worked much better and ended up being included in the final design.

One final tweak we added was to engrave measurement markings on the rockers. The purpose of these was to make aligning the chair easier. To prevent twisting, the chair had to be placed evenly on the rocker, and the markers made this much easier. They were also useful for adjusting the chair to the same position after it had been removed. Their scale was arbitary, and we simply placed ten equally spaced marks, which ended up being roughly two inches apart.

### Bump Stops

![Bump Stops](/assets/geen-2400/bump_stops.jpg){:style="float: left; margin:10px" width="50%"}

To prevent over-rocking, we knew from the beginning that we would use bump stops in some form, but they didn't actually come in to play until near the end. During much of the project, we were unsure how we watned to approach them, coming up with many outlandish ideas that would be difficult to implement. Eventually, we realized that the simplest design was probably the best, and simply embedded pieces of aluminum in the rocker which stuck out enough to stop it. This solution is extremely strong and simple to execute. To determine how much the rocker should be able to rock, we simply sat in the chair and rocked back and forth until as much as we felt was comfortable, and marked that. We then cut the aluminum to that length and embedded it in the rocker.

### Enclosure

![Chalkboard](/assets/geen-2400/chalkboard.jpg){:style="float: right; margin:10px" width="50%"}

The enclosure was a big point of uncertainty throughout the process. Although we started initial concepts for it early, it finally came together very late in the project. While we experiemnted with different concepts of how to approach it, we eventually settled on a very similar design to what we had started with. We decided to make it out of acrylic, because it can be laser cut and is easy to work with. Unfortunately, it's also very ugly, so we decided to turn it into a chalkboard. We used a vinyl chalkboard sticker, which worked well enough and looked quite good, and added customizability to the chair which we really liked. We also cut holes on the inside for the bolts used to secure the chair to stick through, but because they are inside and under the chair we didn't consider them a safety concern. They were also small enough to make it difficlt for foreign objects to get in.

![Espool](/assets/geen-2400/espool.jpg){:style="float: left; margin:10px" width="50%"}

The last major component of the enclosure was the covering on top. We decided to use an elastic fabric material to cover the enclosure, which is both more aesthetically pleasing and helps to futher enclose the rocker. The fabric is attached in two strips, so the chair legs can easily fit through and still rock unencumbered. While the fabric doesn't physically do much to block anything from getting in the box, it acts as a visual barrier, and the clearance between the rocker and the box is low enough that it would be difficult to get anything else in there.

## Testing

Our testing process consisted of two major parts; qualatative (user) and quantative (materials) testing. We wanted to make sure that the rocker was both comfortable and safe.

### User Testing

The qualatative testing was simple- we sat in the chair, and then asked other people to sit in it too. Much of this project was subjectively determining if it was comfortable to rock in, and that was a major factor of each iteration. Throughout the development process the rocker slowly got less and less scary to sit in.

### Materials Testing

![Rocker Materials Test](/assets/geen-2400/rocker_test.png){:style="float: right; margin:10px" width="50%"}

Of course, when developing a product like this it's important to ensure its safety. Although we knew that wood was quite strong, we wanted to make sure there was plenty of safety margin. We used statics analysis to determine the tipping point of the chair to ensure that anyone could sit in it and wouldn't raise the center of gravity high enough for tipping to be a concern, and a universal testing machine to strengh test the wood and acrylic. The wood bore five kilopounds of force before the test was terminated, and showed no signs of failure, only indentations left on the rocker by the testing machine. The acrylic was weaker, but still bore nearly four kilopouns of force before failing. This gave us confidence that the rocker was likely to be stronger than the chair sitting on it, and that it would be safe to use.

## Conclusion

The final product was a success. It was comfortable to sit in, easy to use, and safe. It was also affordable, and we were able to make it for under $100 in materials. We were very happy with the final product, and we felt that it was a great solution to the problem we were trying to solve. Although it could use some more iteration, development, and polish, we feel that it was a great start and consider it to be a successful project. We were also very happy with the team dynamic, and felt that we worked well together and were able to accomplish a lot in a short amount of time.
