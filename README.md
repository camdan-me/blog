# Camdan's Blog

This is the repo that powers my [personal blog](https://blog.camdan.me/). Its runs on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and uses a modified version of the [Pixyll](https://pixyll.com/) theme.

Run the server:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
```
